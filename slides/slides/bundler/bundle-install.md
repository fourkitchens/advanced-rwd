The <code>Gemfile</code> that comes with the project will tell Bundler exactly what versions of what gems to use. Use the following command to create a <code>Gemfile.lock</code> file within your theme to install gem dependencies you may not already have and to lock each gem version.

```bash
bundle install
```

You should <b>NEVER</b> run "sudo bundle install"
