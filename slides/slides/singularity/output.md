## Grid Output Styles

Out of the box, Singularity offers two output styles, <b>float</b> and <b>isolation</b>. The default output style is <b>isolation</b>, but we're going to change it <b>float</b> for now as it will be more familiar to begin with.


```scss
@include sgs-change('output', 'float');
```
