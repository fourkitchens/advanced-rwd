## Bronze challenge:

Create a Ratio Based Grid

* Add ```singularity-extras``` to your Gemfile and install through Bundler. The version should be ```<1.0.0```.
* Require ```singularity-extras``` in your ```config.rb``` file and import ```singularity-extras``` generators into your stylesheets
* Change your grid definition to a 2 column golden ratio based isolation grid
* Remove your ```grid-span``` calls, they're going to break while we drastically change our grids
