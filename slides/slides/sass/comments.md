## Comments

```scss
/*
* This is a standard, multi-line comment
* that will appear in your final .css file
*
* Use multi-line comments to mark major headings or partials
*/

// Single-line comments will NOT appear in your final .css file
// Use single-line comments for developer notes
```

Generally, we leave a standard, multi-line comment on the top of each partial. This will help with debugging because we will always know what partial we are looking at.
