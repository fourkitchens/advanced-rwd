# BOOM!

Yeoman has made all of your sub-theme files, from the .info file to the template.php. It also includes a Gemfile, Sass files, and optionally Gulp, Grunt or Bower files.

Currently, the generator is built to create Subthemes for Aurora and Zen, although new work is constantly being done on it to expand it's functionality. For more information, check out the repository on [Frontend United's GitHub Organization](https://github.com/frontend-united/).
