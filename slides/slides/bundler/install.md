## Bundler: Unifying Gem Versions

When working on different computers, developers, or even projects, there will always be an issue with ruby gems changing between different versions.

We want to make sure that we know which versions of each gem we are using to prevent compiling differences and errors. Bundler allows us to do just that. But first, we need to make sure we have Bundler installed:

```bash
gem install bundler
```
